# Overview

This profile was based upon the work of JohnOCFII with some changes made for the kit Railcore. This profile assumes you have a 0.4mm nozzle and a kit. 

Tl;Dr: More beginner friendly and more generic.

## Major differences

1. The profile includes generic PLA and PETG profiles that should work with most filaments instead of the specific brand tuned profiles.

2. Enabling automatic elephant foot compensation introduced with PrusaSlicer 2.2

3. Spaced support interface layers that are MUCH MUCH easier to remove then solid.

4. Easier to understand print setting descriptions.

5. Small quality of life changes such as supports being off by default and gyroid infill set as default.

6. Both the Railcore ZL and ZLT have profiles by default.

7. Print setting are locked to the printer model giving you a cleaner interface.

## Installation

1. Open PrusaSlicer

2. In PrusaSlicer import via `File -> Import Config Bundle`  drop down menu.

## Contributions

This profile aims to live as upstream as possible so look for the latest updates in the upstream. PRs generally welcome assuming we are aiming towards simplicity and beginner friendliness.
